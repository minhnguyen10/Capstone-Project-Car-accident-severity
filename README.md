# Capstone-Project-Car-accident-severity
Capstone Project for IBM Data Science certificate
Road traffic accidents are financially costly in medical costs. By identifying the circumstances of the accidents that influenced the severity is an importance job.
The dataset provided by Coursera includes Car accident data for the city of Seattle between 2004â€“present
I will use this datataset to train several machine learning models and hence predicting accident severity based on the circumstances of the accidents. By identifying right feature that collerated to the severity, I could then build a model to predict the severity of the accidents based on the circumstances of the accidents
